#Installation
There actually isn't "Installation" for this application simply download the latest version from the releases page and then put it in a directory of your choosing.
#Configuration
This application relies on Last.FM integration to get it's Now Playing information. This decision was made because Last.FM supports the widest number of integrations to different desktop/web media players. I'm not going to go over how to setup Last.FM scrobbling for every media player out there however there should be simple guides for almost all common media players. 

To configure the application for your Last.FM username simply click the settings button and enter your Last.FM username in the field (not your e-mail just the username).Then go ahead and configure an output directory by either clicking once and typing in the full path or double clicking and selecting the output location that you want. After both of these settings have been selected click the save button and then the back button to return to the Main UI.
#Running
To run the app enter your settings on the settings page then click the start button. As soon as you start a song with any media player that is connected to Last.FM the application should start grabbing the information for the song and saving it to the output directory/file you specified as well as displaying that information in the main window.
